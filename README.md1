How to modify a Built React App?
You type in cmd in the react terminal and press enter
You type cd reactapp and press enter
You type npm start and press enter.(This runs in the app in the development mode)
this creates a link http//localhost:3000 which opens in your default browser.
Once you edit and make changes to any of the source code in the reactapp folder, the page of the browser automatically updates itself.
